# project-2: Watchlist
GA project two - full CRUD app
# Tech
I used Visual Studio code as my text editor. I used Node and Express with JSX as the main language. I used mongoDB to store my data. I used React components as well.
# Approach Taken
This is a full-stack CRUD web application. My overall idea was to make a movie watchlist, where you can add your favorite movies or movies you havent seen to a list based on genre. I decided it would be best for me to use a new model for every genre. I used all 7 restful routes for each model as it made sense to have the same functionality for each list and only change the genre. I gave options to add title, image, trailer, and a synopsis. A checkbox also indicates whether or not the movie has been watched or not.
# Unsolved Problems
I was having specificity issues when using Bootstrap for my form page. It seemed no matter what I did, I couldnt add any custom styles to my page. I have yet to finish everthing I would like to do with the app, but its a good start.
# User Stories
I am a huge fan of movies, but I cant always remember what films were recommended to me. This app allows me to store my movies in a list by genre so I can go back and check them off when I watch them. I can update the movie poster, trailer and synopsis with the edit buttons. I can easily delete the movie off my list with the delete button next to the film on the main list page.
# Notes for Future
You left the app in a great start with portfolio syling. The functionality is good as well. In the future you will add a log in page so users can log in and have their own custom lists and profiles. More movie details will be added, like crew members and actors, release dates, and runtimes. I would like to add icons where the buttons are instead. I will also add a drag and drop function so the user can rearrange their list. Maybe I will add an organizational dynamic with "watch next" tags and so on.
